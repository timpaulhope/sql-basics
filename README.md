# Oracle sql cheat-sheets for Analyst
> This is a collection of Oracle SQL Cheat sheets that I've built over the years and still find myself referencing from time-to-time.

## Table of Contents
* [General Info](#general-information)
* [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)

## General Information
- This collection is designed for someone just starting out with Sql in Oracle and offers a few tips and tricks along the way.
- It includes sample scripts that apply common functions to wrangle dates, strings, and numbers to bend them to your will.  
- There are also snippits that show advance features like pivoting and unpivoting data, and using partition clauses for data aggregation.
- Main driver for this project is to share some of the learnings I've made from the hours scrolling through Stack overflow in the hope that it offers some new ways of engineering your data.

## Technologies Used
All you'll need for this is:
- An IDE (Code editor) like Oracle SQL developer; and 
- Access to an Oracle database environment that lets you select the [DUAL](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/queries009.htm) table.
